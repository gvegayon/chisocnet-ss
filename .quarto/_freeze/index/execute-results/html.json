They will also\nhave an overview of the most relevant topics about social networks.\nDuring the week, participants would have lectures and practical\nexperience in using the R software and engage in practical experience\nthrough group projects.\n\nThe course will:\n\n-   Introduce the idea of social network research.\n\n-   Explain how to collect, describe and visualise networks.\n\n-   Explain how to model social networks.\n\n-   Provide hands-on training to use R to investigate social networks.\n\n**Course requirements**\n\nNo prior knowledge of social network analysis is assumed for this\ncourse. However, it would be useful to read *Doing social network\nresearch* (Robins, 2015). SAGE Publications Ltd.* *\n\n**Who is this course for?**\n\nPostgraduate research students, postdocs and academics wishing to use\nSocial Networks in their research.\n\n**Recommended reading**\n\nBorgatti, S.
