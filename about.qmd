The Chilean Society for Social Network Science aims to develop the
Social Network Science in Chile (CHISOCNET) to be in the next decade an
international group of reference from Ibero-America and the
International Community of the Social Network Science.

To achieve this objective, CHISOCNET will congregate, broadcast, and
support the researchers actively working in Social Network Science
within Chile, Ibero-America and abroad.
